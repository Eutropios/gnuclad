HOW TO COMPILE & INSTALL

gnuclad is built with the GNU toolchain, specifically g++ and GNU make.
These are included in most GNU/Linux distributions and can be obtained
from the Xcode developer package on OSX.
On Windows, compilation works flawlessly with MinGW & MSYS, though it should be
possible with other compilers by tweaking the Makefile.

To compile gnuclad, open this folder in a terminal and type:
  make

This will produce a 'gnuclad' binary in the bin folder.
Change to the bin folder and execute gnuclad to get
acquainted with it's syntax:
  cd bin
  ./gnuclad -h

Change to the example folder and generate your first SVG image:
  cd ../EXAMPLE
  ../bin/gnuclad example.csv svg example.conf

In order to install gnuclad on a POSIX conform system, change to the main
directory and run the install routine:
  cd ..
  make install

You should now be able to call gnuclad from any folder.
If you wish to uninstall gnuclad, simply open a terminal in that same
main gnuclad folder and execute:
  make uninstall
