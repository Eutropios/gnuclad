acquainted with it's syntax:

OPTIMISATION - ADDITIONAL INFO:

The current optimisation is greedy and therefore not exactly stellar.
For example, this optimises well:
           4 -> 2
___          ->  ___ ___ ___
        ___  ->      _______
    _______  ->
    ___      ->


But a slightly different map doesn't (a human can easily reduce this to 2):
           4 -> 3
___          ->  ___     ___
        ___  ->      _______
    _______  ->    _____
  _____      ->  

Sorting by start date (see config options) might help a bit.
